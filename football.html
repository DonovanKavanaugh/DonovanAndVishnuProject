	<h2> The NFL</h2>
	
	<body>
		The National Football League is composed of 32 teams across the U.S. The league is split up into two main divisions, the .<br/> NFC and the AFC. There are 4 divisions in both sides and each winner of the division goes to the.<br/> playoffs along with two wild card teams with the highest records. The most recent NFL champions were the Philadelphia Eagles. <br/>

	 <h3> About the Defending Champions</h3>
	 
	 <body>
		The Eagles went 13-3 last season and went into the playoffs as underdogs to the rest of the teams <br/> due to losing their starting quarterback Carson Wentz to an ACL tear. This didn't deter the Eagles hopes and they stormed through the playoffs <br/> and eventually won the Super Bowl with the great play of backup and Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles. <br/>
